    "(A) [5 Pts] Effects of correlation in bagging. In the analysis of bagging, the m bootstrapped datasets drawn from are not independent and we anticipated that we don’t get the 1/m variance reduction in the predictions. Show that if the sampled individual predictions yi have variance σ2 (assuming σ2 > 0 ) and correlation coefficient ρ among each other, then"
