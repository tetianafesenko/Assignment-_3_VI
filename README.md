Homework 3 - Regression Models
We will be exploring an medical cost dataset with various demographic and health information on patients. We can tackle 2 main ideas in supervised learning: (1) regression and (2) classification.

For a regression task, the goal is to predict medical costs (based on insurance claims) using a linear regression model.
For a (binary) classification task, the goal is to predict if the insurance beneficiary is a smoker or a non-smoker with a logistic regression model.
